# Driver-Safety-Enhancement-System
## To track and monitor alertness of driver for road safety

A driving MCU(Micro-Controller-Unit) with i/p signals from activated parts of motor vehicle
like steering input, gear, engine, clutch, brakes, etc will drive the circuitry.
The circuitry will analyze the set of inputs for a given period of time and if the set of inputs remain constant for that time period, MCU will assume that driver is not attentive while driving, and unit will ring a buzzer that will warn the driver to be vigilant. A speed lock system will further add to driver's safety by advising the driver to correct speed, if it has broken the limit. Each time system can be made to reset after it's activation also speed limit can be varied as per driver's convenience.
